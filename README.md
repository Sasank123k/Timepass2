Creating a design document for a UI toolkit website using React involves several sections to ensure clarity and comprehensive coverage of all aspects of the project. Below is a detailed outline of such a design document:

## UI Toolkit Website Design Document

### 1. Overview

#### 1.1 Project Summary
The project aims to develop a UI toolkit website for the company. This toolkit will provide reusable React components that maintain uniformity across all company websites. Developers can copy the code from this toolkit to ensure consistency in design and functionality.

#### 1.2 Objectives
- Develop a comprehensive and reusable UI toolkit.
- Ensure uniformity across the company's websites.
- Provide an easy-to-use platform for developers to integrate components.

### 2. Requirements

#### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- Provide a collection of reusable UI components.
- Include detailed documentation for each component.
- Enable code copying and easy integration.
- Support customization through theming.

#### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- High performance and responsiveness.
- Cross-browser compatibility.
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1).
- Secure and maintainable codebase.

### 3. Architecture

#### 3.1 High-Level Architecture
- **Frontend**: React for building the UI components.
- **Component Library**: Separate package for reusable components.
- **Documentation Site**: Website to display and document components using a static site generator (e.g., Gatsby, Next.js).

#### 3.2 Component Structure
- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (e.g., Buttons, Inputs).
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms (e.g., Form Groups).
- **Organisms**: Complex components (e.g., Navigation Bars, Modals).
- **Templates**: Page-level structures (e.g., Layouts).

### 4. Data Models

#### 4.1 Component Properties
- **Buttons**: Type, size, disabled state, etc.
- **Inputs**: Type, placeholder, validation rules, etc.
- **Modals**: Header, body, footer content, visibility state.

### 5. User Interface Design

#### 5.1 Mockups and Wireframes
- Provide mockups for each component category (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates).
- Create wireframes for the documentation site layout.

#### 5.2 User Flow Diagrams
- Diagram illustrating how a developer navigates the site, selects components, and copies code.

### 6. Technical Specifications

#### 6.1 Technologies
- **React**: Core framework for building components.
- **Styled Components**: For styling and theming.
- **Storybook**: For developing and testing components in isolation.
- **Gatsby/Next.js**: For generating the documentation site.

#### 6.2 Algorithms and Logic
- **Theming**: Implement a theme provider to allow for easy customization of component styles.
- **Code Copy Functionality**: Script to enable one-click code copying.

### 7. Implementation Plan

#### 7.1 Phases and Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Requirement Gathering and Planning
  - Deliverables: Detailed project plan, finalized requirements.
- **Phase 2**: Component Development
  - Deliverables: Atoms and Molecules.
- **Phase 3**: Organisms and Templates
  - Deliverables: Complex components and page structures.
- **Phase 4**: Documentation Site
  - Deliverables: Interactive documentation with examples.
- **Phase 5**: Testing and Quality Assurance
  - Deliverables: Tested components, bug fixes.
- **Phase 6**: Launch and Maintenance
  - Deliverables: Deployed site, maintenance plan.

### 8. Testing Plan

#### 8.1 Testing Strategies
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components using Jest.
- **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Ensure the entire site works as intended (using Cypress).
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1.

#### 8.2 Test Cases
- Component rendering tests.
- Interaction tests (e.g., button clicks).
- Theming and customization tests.

### 9. Maintenance and Support

#### 9.1 Maintenance Plan
- Regular updates to components for new features and bug fixes.
- Monitor and address issues reported by developers.

#### 9.2 Support Plan
- Documentation site with comprehensive guides and FAQs.
- Dedicated support channel for developer queries.
